This repository contains coursework from the Computer Networking class, where I gained hands-on experience in building and analyzing networks. Through several labs, I used Packet Tracer to design and configure various network setups, as well as Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. These labs helped me understand networking protocols, troubleshooting techniques, and the practical application of network management tools.
